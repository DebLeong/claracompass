      <div className="max-w-2xl text-lg text-center leading-relaxed">
        Clara was born from the need for rhythm — not more dashboards, more charts, more noise.
        <br /><br />
        She is your compass. She moves like breath. She listens more than she pushes.
        <br /><br />
        In a world built for speed, Clara slows you down. To notice. To feel. To invest from sovereignty, not stress.
        <br /><br />
        Clara is made for women. And for anyone ready to walk in time with their own clarity.
